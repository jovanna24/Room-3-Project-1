Project Title: Git Connected with Nonprofits in your Community!

User Story: As a community member, I want to get connected with local nonprofit organizations that I can volunteer my time towards projects and purposes that Iâ€™m passionate about.  

USER FLOW/CHECKLIST TO COMPLETION

WE ARE DONE WHEN
- The site has title, description, attractive UI styling
- When user clicks on <open form> a modal dialog appears
- The user selects a category that has a value matching the query search parameter value for PROPUBLICA API
- The user inputs a location that is used with a map API to retrieve a location display result
- When submit search button is clicked, thisSearch is saved to fill fetchAPI functions, modal is closed
- The page reloads to display a list of 10 search results per page next to a map-container
- Each result has a <checkbox>
- When checked, the result will be saved in localStorage as userInterests object
- Data stored in local storage persists
- The location of a selected result can be viewed using a <find org> button
- Each result has a working url that links to the org site
- Footer contains authorship information
- We demo the application with multiple locations and retrieve results consistently
- We deploy the application per assignment guidelines using GitHub Pages
